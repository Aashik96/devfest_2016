DevFest 2016
============

This year, the sessions are aimed at both emerging and evolving technologies related to mobile applications development. You will be able to hear from the best developers who work with industry leaders. All our speakers are hand-picked for their expertise in their relevant fields. 

As usual, you will be able to interact with the speakers and get the best out of the time. As all of them encourage questions about their topics, if you are interested or if the question is in the relevant field of development, please bring your questions before-hand. We are sure they will clear your doubts if there is adequate time during the session. If not, most of our speakers will stay along the entire session time. So, you can go meet them in-person for more questions. 

Be ready for some novel experiences as GDG Sri Lanka will be bringing you an interesting DevFest keeping with the tradition of gradually improving each year.
